## Configuration

The application uses Supabase for backend services. Configuration is currently hardcoded in `main.dart`. For production use, consider moving these to environment variables or a configuration file.

## Building for Release

### Android
```bash
flutter build apk --release
# or for app bundle
flutter build appbundle --release
```

### Windows
```bash
flutter build windows --release
```

### Linux
```bash
flutter build linux --release
```

### macOS
```bash
flutter build macos --release
```

## Dependencies

Key dependencies include:
- **hooks_riverpod**: State management
- **go_router**: Navigation and routing
- **supabase_flutter**: Backend services and authentication
- **dio**: HTTP client
- **freezed**: Code generation for immutable classes
- **flutter_animate**: Animation utilities

See `pubspec.yaml` for the complete list of dependencies.

## Development

### Code Generation

This project uses code generation for:
- Riverpod providers (`riverpod_generator`)
- JSON serialization (`json_serializable`)
- Freezed classes (`freezed`)

Run code generation with:
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

For watch mode (auto-regenerate on file changes):
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Linting

The project uses `custom_lint` and `flutter_lints` for code quality. Run:
```bash
flutter analyze
```
